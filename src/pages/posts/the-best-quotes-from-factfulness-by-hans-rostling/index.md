I just read [Factfulness: Ten Reasons We're Wrong About the World--and Why Things Are Better Than You Think](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0756J1LLV/) by the late Hans Rosling, his son Ola Rosling, and his daughter-in-law Anna Rosling Rönnlund.

**Bill Gates** called it “one of the best books I’ve read in a long time”. [Read his full review here](https://www.gatesnotes.com/Books/Factfulness?WT.mc_id=04_03_2018_07_Factfulness_BG-TW_&WT.tsrc=BGTW&linkId=50040224).

Here are some of the quotes I liked (emphasis mine).

<post-separator></post-separator>

## On Gates Foundation

Page 90:

> \[Melinda and Bill Gates\] have spent billions of dollars to save the lives of millions of children in extreme poverty by investing in primary health care and education. Yet intelligent and well-meaning people keep contacting their foundation saying that they should stop. The argument goes like this: **“If you keep saving poor children, you’ll kill the planet by causing overpopulation.”**
>
> … “Saving poor children just increases the population” sounds correct, **but the opposite is true**. … The only proven method for curbing population growth is to eradicate extreme poverty and give people better lives, including education and contraceptives.

## On “Now is not the time to politicize X” argument after crisis

Page 111:

> \[W\]hen that camera pans to bodies of dead children being pulled out of the debris, my intellectual capacity is blocked by fear and sorrow. At that moment, no line chart in the world can influence my feelings, no facts can comfort me. Claiming in that moment that things are getting better would be to trivialize the immense suffering of those victims and their families. It would be absolutely unethical. **In these situations we must forget the big picture and do everything we can to help.**
>
> **The big facts and the big picture must wait until the danger is over. But then we must dare to establish a fact-based worldview again.** We must cool our brains and compare the numbers to make sure our resources are used effectively to stop future suffering. We can’t let fear guide these priorities.

## On anti-vaccination

Page 116:

> **\[I\]f you are skeptical about the measles vaccination, I ask you to do two things.** First, make sure you know what it looks like when a child dies from measles. Most children who catch measles recover, but there is still no cure and even with the best modern medicine, one or two in every thousand will die of it. Second, ask yourself, **“What kind of evidence would convince me to change my mind?”** If the answer is “no evidence could ever change my mind about vaccination,” then you are putting yourself outside evidence-based rationality, outside the very critical thinking that first brought you to this point. In that case, to be consistent in your skepticism about science, **next time you have an operation please ask your surgeon not to bother washing her hands.**

## On child survival and education

Page 129:

> \[A\]lmost all the increased child survival is achieved through preventive **measures outside hospitals** by local nurses, midwives, and well-educated parents. Especially mothers: **the data shows that half the increase in child survival in the world happens because the mothers can read and write.** … So if you are investing money to improve health on Level 1 or 2, you should put it into primary schools, nurse education, and vaccinations.

Page 193:

> \[T\]he most valuable intervention for saving the lives of the poorest mothers is not training more local nurses to perform C-sections, or better treatment of severe bleeding or infections, **but the availability of transport to the local hospital.** The hospitals were of limited use if women could not reach them: if there were no ambulances, or no roads for the ambulances to travel on. Similarly, educators know that **it is often the availability of electricity** rather than more textbooks or even more teachers in the classroom that has the most impact on learning, as students can do their homework after sunset.

## On Vietnam War

Page 131:

> At the weekend, I asked Niem to show me the monument to the Vietnam War. “You mean the ‘Resistance War Against America,’” he said. Of course, I should have realized he wouldn’t call it the Vietnam War. Niem drove me to one of the city’s central parks and showed me a small stone with a brass plate, three feet high. I thought it was a joke. … Seeing that I was disappointed, Niem drove me to see a bigger monument: a marble stone, 12 feet high, to commemorate independence from French colonial rule. I was still underwhelmed.
>
> Then Niem asked me if I was ready to see the proper war monument. He drove a little way further, and pointed out of the window. Above the treetops I could see a large pagoda, covered in gold. It seemed about 300 feet high. He said, “Here is where we commemorate our war heroes. Isn’t it beautiful?” This was the monument to Vietnam’s wars with China.
>
> **The wars with China had lasted, on and off, for 2,000 years. The French occupation had lasted 200 years. The “Resistance War Against America” took only 20 years. The sizes of the monuments put things in perfect proportion.** It was only by comparing them that I could understand the relative insignificance of “the Vietnam War” to the people who now live in Vietnam.

## On vaccines and investment opportunities

Page 147:

> Vaccines must be kept cold all the way from the factory to the arm of the child. They are shipped in refrigerated containers to harbors around the world, where they get loaded into refrigerated trucks. These trucks take them to local health clinics, where they are stored in refrigerators. These logistic distribution paths are called cool chains. For cool chains to work, you need all the basic infrastructure for transport, electricity, education, and health care to be in place. **This is exactly the same infrastructure needed to establish new factories.**

## On half-built houses

Page 160:

> If you were to visit Tunisia, a country where you find people living on every level from 1 to 4, you might come across **houses that were half-built**…. You might conclude that Tunisians were lazy or disorganized. …
>
> In Sweden, if someone built their house like that, we would think they had a severe planning problem, or maybe the builders had run away. But you can’t generalize from Sweden to Tunisia.
>
> On Levels 2 and 3, families often do not have access to a bank to put their savings and cannot get a loan. So, to save up to improve their home, they must pile up money. **Money, though, can be stolen or lose its value through inflation. So, instead, whenever they can afford them, \[they\] buy actual bricks, which won’t lose their value.** But there is no space inside to store the bricks and the bricks might get stolen if they are left in a pile outside. Better to add the bricks to the house as you buy them. Thieves can’t steal them. Inflation won’t change their value. No one needs to check your credit rating. And over 10 or 15 years you are slowly building your family a better home. Instead of assuming that \[they\] are lazy or disorganized, assume they are smart and ask yourself, **How can this be such a smart solution?**

## On countries in North Africa

Page 170:

> Not all African countries are lagging the world. Five large African countries—Tunisia, Algeria, Morocco, Libya, and Egypt—have life expectancies above the world average of 72 years. They are where Sweden was in 1970. Those despairing for Africa may not be convinced by this example. **They may say that these are all Arab countries on the north coast of Africa and therefore not the Africa they had in mind. When I was young, these countries were certainly seen as sharing Africa’s destiny.** It is only since they made progress that they have been held to be exceptional.

## On family size

Page 174:

> In 1960, there were 40 countries where women had fewer than 3.5 babies on average, and they were all Christian-majority countries, except Japan. **It appeared that to have few babies, you had either to be Christian or Japanese.** …
>
> How does it look today? … The pattern is very similar: regardless of religion, women have more children if they live in extreme poverty on Level 1. **Today, Muslim women have on average 3.1 children. Christian women have 2.7.** There is no major difference between the birth rates of the great world religions.

Page 215:

> The pope is also credited with enormous influence over the sexual behavior of the 1 billion Catholics in the world. However, despite the clear condemnation of the use of contraception by several successive popes, the statistics show that **contraceptive use is 60 percent in Catholic-majority countries, compared with 58 percent in the rest of the world. In other words, it is the same.**

## On abortion and culture

Page 176:

> A woman’s right to an abortion is supported by just about everyone in Sweden today. Strong support for women’s rights in general has become part of our culture. My students’ jaws drop when I tell them how different things were when I was a student in the 1960s. Abortion in Sweden was still, except on very limited grounds, illegal. At the university, we ran a secret fund to pay for women to travel abroad to get safe abortions. Jaws drop even further when I tell the students where these young pregnant students traveled to: **Poland**. Catholic Poland. **Five years later, Poland banned abortion and Sweden legalized it. The flow of young women started to go the other way.** The point is, it was not always so. The cultures changed.

## On qualitative metrics of income

Page 191:

> The prime minister of Mozambique from 1994 to 2004, Pascoal Mocumbi, visited Stockholm in 2002 and told me that his country was making great economic progress. I asked him how he knew; after all, the quality of the economic statistics in Mozambique was probably not very good. Had he looked at GDP per capita?
>
> “I do look at those figures,” he said. “but they are not so accurate. So I have also made it a habit to watch the marches on May first every year. They are a popular tradition in our country. **And I look at people’s feet, and what kind of shoes they have.** I know that people do their best to look good on that day. I know that they cannot borrow their friend’s shoes, because their friend will be out marching too. So I look. And I can see if they walk barefoot, or if they have bad shoes, or if they have good shoes. And I can compare what I see with what I saw last year.

## On ineffectiveness of simple ideas for complex problems

Page 192:

> In the 1950s, a Danish public health doctor, Halfdan Mahler, suggested to the World Health Organization a way to eradicate tuberculosis. His project sent small buses with X-ray machines trundling around villages in India. It was a simple idea: eradicate one disease, and it’s gone. **The plan was to X-ray the whole population, find those with TB, and treat them. But it failed because the people got angry.** They all had tons of urgent health problems, and finally here was a bus with nurses and doctors. But instead of fixing a broken bone, or giving fluids for diarrhea, or helping a woman in childbirth, they wanted to X-ray everyone for a disease they had never heard of.

## On U.S. healthcare policy

Page 198:

> \[T\]here is a small number of rich countries with life expectancies as low as that in the United States: **the rich Gulf states of Oman, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, United Arab Emirates, and Kuwait.** But these states have a very different history. Until the 1960s when they really started getting rich on oil, their populations were poor and illiterate. Their health systems have been built in just two generations. Unlike the United States, these states are not constrained by a suspicion of anything governmental and I would not be surprised if within a couple of years they all had higher life expectancies than the United States. **Perhaps the United States will then be less reluctant to learn from them than it is to learn from Western European countries.**

## On fake news

Page 209:

> I do not believe that fake news is the major culprit for our distorted worldview: we haven’t only just started to get the world wrong, **I think we have always gotten it wrong.**

## On refugees, and looking at yourself in the mirror

Page 212:

> **\[W\]hy weren’t the refugees traveling to Europe on comfortable planes or ferry boats** instead of traveling over land to Libya or Turkey and then entrusting their lives to these rickety rubber rafts? After all, all EU member states were signed up to the Geneva Convention, and it was clear that refugees from war-torn Syria would be entitled to claim asylum under its terms. I started to ask this question of journalists, friends, and people involved in the reception of the asylum seekers, but even the wisest and kindest among them came up with very strange answers.
>
> Perhaps they could not afford to fly? But we knew that the refugees were paying 1,000 euros for each place on a rubber dinghy. I went online and checked and there were plenty of tickets from Turkey to Sweden or from Libya to London for under 50 euros. Maybe they couldn’t reach the airport? Not true. Many of them were already in Turkey or Lebanon and could easily get to the airport. And they can afford a ticket, and the planes are not overbooked. But at the check-in counter, they are stopped by the airline staff from getting onto the plane. Why? **Because of a European Council Directive from 2001 that tells member states how to combat illegal immigration. This directive says that every airline or ferry company that brings a person without proper documents into Europe must pay all the costs of returning that person to their country of origin.** Of course the directive also says that it doesn’t apply to refugees who want to come to Europe based on their rights to asylum under the Geneva Convention, only to illegal immigrants. But that claim is meaningless. **Because how should someone at the check-in desk at an airline be able to work out in 45 seconds whether someone is a refugee or is not a refugee according to the Geneva Convention?** Something that would take the embassy at least eight months? It is impossible. So the practical effect of the reasonable-sounding directive is that commercial airlines will not let anyone board without a visa. And getting a visa is nearly impossible because the European embassies in Turkey and Libya do not have the resources to process the applications. Refugees from Syria, with the **theoretical** right to enter Europe under the Geneva Convention, are therefore in practice completely unable to travel by air and so must come over the sea.
>
> Why, then, must they come in such terrible boats? Actually, EU policy is behind that as well, **because it is EU policy to confiscate the boats when they arrive.** So boats can be used for one trip only. The smugglers could not afford to send the refugees in safe boats, like the fishing boats that brought 7,220 Jewish refugees from Denmark to Sweden over a few days in 1943, even if they wanted to.

## Final thoughts from the book

As someone who traveled to [94 cities in 36 countries](/posts/world-travel-2017-2018/) last year, I found that by actually seeing the world with your own eyes, you become more humble. The tone of Hans's book was exactly that.

Here's one final quote from the book I liked (page 153) - I felt exactly like this when I gave a talk in Bangladesh last year:

> In 1972, as a fourth-year medical student, I studied at the medical school in Bangalore. The first class I attended was on examining kidney X-rays. Looking at the first image, I realized this must be kidney cancer. I decided to wait awhile before telling the class, out of respect. I didn’t want to show off. Several hands then went into the air and the Indian students one by one explained how best to diagnose this cancer, how and where it usually spreads, and how best to treat it. On and on they went for 30 minutes, answering questions I thought only chief physicians knew. I realized my embarrassing mistake. I must have come to the wrong room. These must not be fourth-year students, these must be specialists. I had nothing to add to their analysis.
>
> On our way out, I told a fellow student I was supposed to be with the fourth-years. “That’s us,” he said. I was stunned. They had caste marks on their foreheads and lived where exotic palm trees grew. **How could they know much more than me? Over the next few days I learned that they had a textbook three times as thick as mine, and they had read it three times as many times.**
>
> I remember this whole experience as the first time in my life that **I suddenly had to change my worldview: my assumption that I was superior because of where I came from….**
