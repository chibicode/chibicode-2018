Last year, Dan Abramov from the React team gave an excellent talk called "[The Melting Pot of JavaScript](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G39lKaONAlA)". Here are my top three favorite quotes.

## Quote 1

Around 12:11:

> As tool builders we often view configuration as a feature. Somebody tells us: "Well, if you just have this feature I'll be able to use this project at my company." And you think: "Great, I'm helping people by adding it."
>
> But we should factor in the invisible cost that it causes both for people who use that feature and for people who don't use it. It's the cost of learning about this feature. The cost of misunderstanding it.â€¦people thinking: "Was that the right thing to do? Did I pick the right option?"

## Quote 2

Around 13:10:

> If you're building tools like me, there's this fact that we have become the new gatekeepers to one of the largest programming communities in the world.
>
> And this is scary stuff. Because it means that every time our tool prints an incomprehensible error message, somebody somewhere decides that they're just not cut out for programming. And this is a big responsibility.

## Quote 3

Around 27:19:

> If you're a maintainer of an open-source project it is invaluable to go out there in the field and see what they struggle with as they try to use your projects.
>
> And if you think improving newcomer experience is polish, it's not polish. If you go out there in the field you will see that it makes a real difference in people's lives, and what they can learn, and what they can build with it. So it's not just polish. Take this seriously.
