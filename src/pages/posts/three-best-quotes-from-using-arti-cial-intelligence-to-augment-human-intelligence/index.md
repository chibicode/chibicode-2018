As someone who studied interface design in college and has worked as a designer/frontend engineer, ["Using Artificial Intelligence to Augment Human Intelligence"](https://distill.pub/2017/aia/) by Shan Carter and Michael Nielsen was a great read. Here are the three quotes I especially liked.

<post-separator></post-separator>

Emphasis mine.

## Quote 1

> Historically, lasting cognitive technologies have been invented only rarely. But modern computers are a meta-medium enabling the rapid invention of many new cognitive technologies. Consider a relatively banal example, such as Photoshop. **Adept Photoshop users routinely have formerly impossible thoughts such as: “let’s apply the clone stamp to the such-and-such layer.”. That’s an instance of a more general class of thought: “computer, [new type of action] this [new type of representation for a newly imagined class of object]”.** When that happens, we’re using computers to expand the range of thoughts we can think.

## Quote 2

> Ideally, an interface will surface the deepest principles underlying a subject, revealing a new world to the user. When you learn such an interface, you internalize those principles, giving you more powerful ways of reasoning about that world. Those principles are the diffs in your understanding. They’re all you really want to see, everything else is at best support, at worst unimportant dross. **The purpose of the best interfaces isn’t to be user-friendly in some shallow sense. It’s to be user-friendly in a much stronger sense, reifying deep principles about the world**, making them the working conditions in which users live and create. At that point what once appeared strange can instead becomes comfortable and familiar, part of the pattern of thought.

## Quote 3

> It is conventional wisdom that AI will change how we interact with computers. **Unfortunately, many in the AI community greatly underestimate the depth of interface design, often regarding it as a simple problem, mostly about making things pretty or easy-to-use.** In this view, interface design is a problem to be handed off to others, while the hard work is to train some machine learning system.
>
> **This view is incorrect.** At its deepest, interface design means developing the fundamental primitives human beings think and create with. This is a problem whose intellectual genesis goes back to the inventors of the alphabet, of cartography, and of musical notation, as well as modern giants such as Descartes, Playfair, Feynman, Engelbart, and Kay. **It is one of the hardest, most important and most fundamental problems humanity grapples with.**
