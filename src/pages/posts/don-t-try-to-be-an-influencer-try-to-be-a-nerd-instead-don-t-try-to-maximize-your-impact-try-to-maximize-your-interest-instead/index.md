  Don't try to be an influencer. Try to be a nerd instead. Don't maximize
  your impact. Maximize your interest instead.

In my 20s, I tried to become an influential person - and that was one of the biggest mistakes I made.

<post-separator></post-separator>

Throughout the history, people have always pursued money and power.

Power implies *influence*, and with the advent of technology it's much easier now to become an influencer (*e.g. a Youtube star*) or even a micro-influencer (*e.g. gets 1k likes on Instagram photos*). You can be an influencer who has a positive impact on others (*e.g. a designer of a popular game*), and/or an influencer who helps others become influencers (*e.g. a tech investor*).

**Yet**, not everyone can try to become an influencer and actually turn into one. There will always be winners and losers, because the *ingredients* of influence—people's needs or attention—are more or less *finite*. Some people will never capture other people's needs or attention.

In my 20s, I became a micro-influencer of a small subset of the Japanese blogosphere. But I failed to even be a micro-influencer in almost every other fields I gave a shot at. And because I wanted to be influential—and believed that having influence is a good metric of my success or worthiness—my failure to become influential gave my sense of self-worth a major blow.

## There's a better way

As I turned 30 after [traveling the world](/posts/world-travel-2017-2018), I let it all go. I no longer set becoming an influencer as my goal.

Instead, I now try to be a **nerd** and be devoted to whatever I'm interested in. Being influential is secondary or even less important. Being a nerd is always a winning strategy - there's no way to lose (unless you try to become the *best* nerd, which you shouldn't try). And being devoted to something actually can help you become influential, *if you're lucky*.

I no longer care about maximizing my impact to the world. I now only care about maximizing my interest for things I like.

I also realized that I actually couldn't care less about making the world a better place. Of course I'd like the humanity to prosper, but to be completely honest, I no longer feel the pressure to be involved in *shaping* the society.

This has certainly made me happier. Hope this advice helps you somehow.
