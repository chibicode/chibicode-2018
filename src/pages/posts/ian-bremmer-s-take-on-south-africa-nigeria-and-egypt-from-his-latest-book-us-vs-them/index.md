I just finished [Ian Bremmer](https://twitter.com/ianbremmer)'s latest book *[Us vs. Them: The Failure of Globalism](https://www.amazon.com/Us-vs-Them-Failure-Globalism-ebook/dp/B074DG6K8K/).* To me, the most interesting part of the book was **chapter 3**, where Ian, an acclaimed political scientist, talked about the outlook of the 12 most-important developing economies (according to Ian):

1. ğŸ‡¹ğŸ‡· Turkey
1. ğŸ‡·ğŸ‡º Russia
1. ğŸ‡®ğŸ‡© Indonesia
1. ğŸ‡®ğŸ‡³ India
1. ğŸ‡¨ğŸ‡³ China

2. Africa's 2050 share of the world's population: 26% (2.53 billion)
3. Africa's 2100 share of the world's population: 40% (4.47 billion, almost the same as Asia)

And **by 2050, 50%** of the population (more than 1 billion) in Africa will still be **under the age of 25**. Global capitalists will need to create jobs for themâ€”or else massive unemployment will
