Yesterday [I wrote some of my favorite quotes from "Factfulness" by Hans Rosling](/posts/the-best-quotes-from-factfulness-by-hans-rostling/). There was one quote I left out, the one about **"bad and better."**

<post-separator></<post-separator>

From page 70 (emphasis mine):

> It seems that when we hear someone say things are getting better, we think they are also saying “don’t worry, relax” or even “look away.” But when I say things are getting better, I am not saying those things at all. I am certainly not advocating looking away from the terrible problems in the world. **I am saying that things can be both bad and better.**
>
> Think of the world as a premature baby in an incubator. The baby’s health status is extremely bad and her breathing, heart rate, and other important signs are tracked constantly so that changes for better or worse can quickly be seen. After a week, she is getting a lot better. On all the main measures, she is improving, but she still has to stay in the incubator because her health is still critical. Does it make sense to say that the infant’s situation is improving? **Yes. Absolutely.** Does it make sense to say it is bad? Yes, absolutely. Does saying “things are improving” imply that everything is fine, and we should all relax and not worry? **No, not at all.** Is it helpful to have to choose between bad and improving? Definitely not. It’s both. It’s both bad and better. Better, and bad, at the same time.
>
> That is how we must think about the current state of the world.

Hans said this in the context of poverty in the world. Bill Gates, who spoke highly of the book, recites this idea on [his book review](https://www.gatesnotes.com/Books/Factfulness) (emphasis *not* mine):

> Imagine news coverage about a natural disaster—say, a tornado that kills 10 people in a small town. If you look at only the headlines, you’ll view the event as an unbearable tragedy (which it is). But if you put it in the context of history, you’ll also know that tornadoes today are a lot less deadly than they used to be, thanks to advanced warning systems. That’s no consolation to the loved ones of those who died, but it matters a great deal to everyone who survived the tornado.

> **In other words, the world can be both bad and better.** That idea drives the work Melinda and I do every day, and Hans articulates it beautifully in Factfulness.

## You can also be bad and better

But this idea of "bad and better" applies to *yourself* as well.

Looking at myself in the mirror, I realize that I have numerous personality flaws. *For one, it's extremely difficult for me to stay humble like Hans*, even though I have no achievements to back up my arrogance.

And my personality flaws manifest themselves in my words and actions over and over again. Every time that happens, I get the feeling that I'd always be vain for the rest of my life.

**But**: Looking back at my old conversation logs, I also know that I'm less pretentious than my younger self from 5 years ago. I'm not humble, but more modest than before. Of course, I am improving at much, much slower rate than countries in Africa. Nonetheless, *personality wise, I'm both bad and better* today.

**Conclusion:** I think "bad and better" is a good framework to reflect on your weaknesses. *Your weaknesses are not something you should be proud of, because they're bad, but they're also not something you should dread too much about, as long as they're getting better.*
