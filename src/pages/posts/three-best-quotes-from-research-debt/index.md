As someone who's done a lot of expository writing online ([in Japanese](https://chibicode.com/jp/)), I resonated deeply with [“Research Debt”](https://distill.pub/2017/research-debt/) by Chris Olah and Shan Carter, although I'm not a researcher. Here are the three quotes I especially liked (emphasis mine).

<post-separator></post-separator>

## Quote 1

> **There’s a tradeoff between the energy put into explaining an idea, and the energy needed to understand it.** On one extreme, the explainer can painstakingly craft a beautiful explanation, leading their audience to understanding without even realizing it could have been difficult. On the other extreme, the explainer can do the absolute minimum and abandon their audience to struggle. This energy is called [interpretive labor](https://acesounderglass.com/2015/06/09/interpretive-labor/).
>
> … In research, we often have a group of researchers all trying to understand each other. Just like before, the cost of explaining stays constant as the group grows, but the cost of understanding increases with each new member. At some size, the effort to understand everyone else becomes too much. **As a defense mechanism, people specialize, focusing on a narrower area of interest.** The maintainable size of the ﬁeld is controlled by how its members trade off the energy between communicating and understanding.

## Quote 2

> Distillation is also hard. **It’s tempting to think of explaining an idea as just putting a layer of polish on it, but good explanations often involve transforming the idea.** This kind of refinement of an idea can take just as much effort and deep understanding as the initial discovery.
>
> This leaves us with no easy way out. **We can’t solve research debt by having one person write a textbook: their energy is spread too thin to polish every idea from scratch.** We can’t outsource distillation to less skilled non-experts: refining and explaining ideas requires creativity and deep understanding, just as much as novel research.

## Quote 3

> Why do researchers not work on distillation? One possibility is perverse incentives, like wanting your work to look difficult. **Those certainly exist, but we don’t think they’re the main factor.** Another possibility is that they don’t enjoy research distillation. **Again, we don’t think that’s what’s going on.**
>
> Lots of people want to work on research distillation. Unfortunately, it’s very difficult to do so, because we don’t support them. 
>
> An aspiring research distiller lacks many things that are easy to take for granted: **a career path, places to learn, examples and role models.** Underlying this is a deeper issue: **their work isn’t seen as a real research contribution.** We need to ﬁx this.
